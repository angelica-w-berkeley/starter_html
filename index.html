            <img src="images/bacon.jpg" width = "400" alt="Brown labradoodle wearing colorful lei">

            <p>Bacon Q. Dog is a 9yr old labradoodle. He prefers to spend his days lounging among the three different beds/couches that his family has gifted him. He enjoys a walk or two around the neighborhood, as long as he can pretend that he doesn't see any of the other animals to avoid the embarrassment of not wanting to admit he has no wolf-like skills in chasing them.</p> 
            <P>At night just as the rest of the family is ready to relax, Bacon suddenly wants to release all of his energy. He will place his toys on a mini couch and frantically drag the couch around, giving his toys "a ride." There is also a lot of rolling. Lots and lots of rolling.</P>

            <p>
                Fitz is a Boston terrier that loves chasing tennis balls, chipmunks, squirrels, and birds. He is often found sitting by the fire in the wintertime as well as sun patches when their available. He's energetic, mischievous, and easily bored. He loves people and gets grumpy if left without a lap too long. 
            </p> 
            <p>
                Fitz loves barking up trees, running around on the lawn, and digging in the dirt looking for moles. He especially likes getting treats and whines when he comes inside and doesn't get a snack.

            <p>
                With a coat as dark as midnight and eyes as bright as stars, he seems to embody both the mystery and exuberance of life itself. Agile and playful, he dances around the park as if the grass is his personal stage, captivating everyone with his vivacity.
            </p> 
            <p>
                Yet at home, Chako transforms into a zan master. He curls up on his favorite rug, eyes half-closed in contemplation, as if solving the great puzzles of the universe. Both spirited and serene, Chako is a living testament to the richness of dualities, teaching his human companions that one could be many things all at once.

            <p>
                Maple is a 2 year-old tabby cat with brown stripes. She is very playful and friendly, but she also loves loungin in the sun. Maple is a huge fan of treats - she has even learned how to open doors to steal some extra treats.
            </p> 
            <p>
                Sometimes Maple has boundless energy. At night, she gets the zoomies after eating her final meal of the day. It usually takes her another hour to settle down before she can take a long nap.
